## Sample Data Analytics Projects

### Project 1: Health Care (COVID-19)
I want to be upfront about this: I chose a simple project with easy-to-follow instructions for my first attempt since I don’t have much experience in the data analytics field. However, I made some changes and added elements that I believed would enhance the project.

#### Resources
- Youtube Tutorial by: Alex The Analyst - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM">Data Analyst Portfolio Project</a>
- Data source: Our World in Data - <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">Covid Deaths</a>
- Data File: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">CSV File</a>

#### Questions

I try to come up with interesting and challenging questions for this project, ones that would push me to think creatively. Some of these questions emerged in the middle of the project as I found inspiration while working through the data.

**Primary objectives**
- Provide data analytics of COVID-19 in the World
- Simulate Forecasting
- Utilize Skillset in Project


#### Data Cleaning
 I didn’t do much data cleaning in the Excel/CSV file as I was following the tutorial closely. In hindsight, I realized that many of the columns in the dataset were unnecessary. To address this, I created a sample of how I would clean up the data.

<a href="https://github.com/JonCarel/JonCarel.github.io/blob/4e2aa788886afa78aa66216f8cbf489dfeb59e6d/excel/Sample_Data_Cleaning.xlsx">Sample Cleaning Data</a>
  
#### Data Analysis

Here are the sql queries I used to aid in the Visualization/Data Analysis. The CSV file is broken into two excel file in order to utilize the join function

Here are the samples of the results of the query in excel: <a href="https://github.com/JonCarel/JonCarel.github.io/blob/f1d1ab19a5a04a33a18bb4655d190c4ed031bc9e/excel/SQL_QUERY_OUTPUT_SAMPLE.xlsx">SQL Query Output Sample</a>

#### Data Visualization

To tie everything up here are some visualizations I made using Tableau Public and Power BI

COVID-19 Cases and Deaths:

COVID-19 Vaccinations:

#### Conclusion

Despite the significant number of cases and deaths, the growth of COVID-19 appears to have slowed down. However, the data collected is insufficient to definitively attribute the decline in COVID-19 cases to the vaccines. If vaccinations were effective, we would expect to see a negative correlation between the number of vaccinations and new COVID-19 cases. Instead, the data reveals a weak positive correlation between the two. Therefore, the current data is inadequate to conclude that the vaccinations are effective.

#### Recommendation

1. Investigate additional factors that could influence the decline of COVID-19.
2. Utilize alternative statistical tools for a more comprehensive analysis.

**Footnote: The effectiveness of the vaccine is not immediate; therefore, I suggest that data regarding vaccinations be shifted by one week to one month prior to the number of new cases when conducting statistical analyses.

### Project 2.1: Finance (Ongoing)
For my next project, I want to apply my skills to report making in finance. I also want to learn new techniques and explore how report making in Excel can be applied in Power BI. I could not find a data set that is applicable for my project, so i used a sample dataset from PowerBI

#### Resources
- Data File: <a href="https://github.com/JonCarel/JonCarel.github.io/blob/0f0f6aee5d817ff514dbcd27ce7ceb86f6355788/excel/Project_2.xlsx">Excel File</a>

#### Questions

I want to provide answers to common questions that business owners have and make the reports interactive

**Primary objectives**
- Provide KPIs
- Construct a simple Income Statement
- Make an Interactive Dashboard

#### Data Visualization

### Project 2.2: Accounting
Before tackling financial statements in Power BI and Tableua, I wanted to first work on them in Excel to showcase my abilities with Excel functions like VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP, as well as features like pivot tables.

#### Resources
I couldn't find a journal online that I could use for this project, but since I have a background in accounting, I created journal entries for a startup company, CHIA LTD.
Here is the complete<a href="https://github.com/JonCarel/JonCarel.github.io/blob/5f9cb82a11e9c81e06b6da1bdda15e1d9ed16de6/excel/Project_2.2_Accounting.xlsx">Excel File</a> for your reference.

Also, Here are the journal Entries used in this Project

1. General Ledger/Ledgers
2. Trial Balance
3. Income Statement
4. Balance Sheet

#### Data Visualization

Here are the sample of the Financial Statements I Created
