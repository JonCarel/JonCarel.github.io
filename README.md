## Sample Data Analytics Projects

### Project 1: Health Care (COVID-19)
I want to be upfront about this: I chose a simple project with easy-to-follow instructions for my first attempt since I don’t have much experience in the data analytics field. However, I made some changes and added elements that I believed would enhance the project.

#### Resources
- Youtube Tutorial by: Alex The Analyst - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM">Data Analyst Portfolio Project</a>
- Data source: Our World in Data - <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">Covid Deaths</a>
- Data File: <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">CSV File</a>

#### Questions

I try to come up with interesting and challenging questions for this project, ones that would push me to think creatively. Some of these questions emerged in the middle of the project as I found inspiration while working through the data.

**Primary objectives**
- Provide data analytics of COVID-19 in the World
- Simulate Forecasting
- Utilize Skillset in Project


#### Data Cleaning
 I didn’t do much data cleaning in the Excel/CSV file as I was following the tutorial closely. In hindsight, I realized that many of the columns in the dataset were unnecessary. To address this, I created a sample of how I would clean up the data.

#### Data Analysis

Here are the sql queries I used to aid in the Visualization/Data Analysis
The CSV file is broken into two excel file in order to utilize the join function

Here are the samples of the results of the query in excel: <a href="https://github.com/JonCarel/JonCarel.github.io/blob/f1d1ab19a5a04a33a18bb4655d190c4ed031bc9e/excel/SQL_QUERY_OUTPUT_SAMPLE.xlsx">SQL Query Output Sample</a>

#### Data Visualization

To tie everything up here are some visualizations I made using Tableau Public

COVID-19 Cases and Deaths

#### Conclusion

Despite the significant number of cases and deaths, the growth of COVID-19 appears to have slowed down.

#### Recommendation

Investigate the factors that contributed to the slowdown in COVID-19 growth.

**Footnote**
- I plan to add a new dashboard that relates vaccination rates to the growth of COVID-19.


### Project 2: Finance (Ongoing)
