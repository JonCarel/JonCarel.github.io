## Sample Data Analytics Projects

### Project 1: Health Care (Covid)
I want to be upfront about this: I chose a simple project with easy-to-follow instructions for my first attempt since I don’t have much experience in the data analytics field. However, I made some changes and added elements that I believed would enhance the project.

#### Resources
- Youtube Tutorial by: Alex The Analyst - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfyynHBFOsM">Data Analyst Portfolio Project</a>
- Data source: Our World in Data - <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">Covdid Deaths</a>
- Data File: <a href="<a href="https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths">Covdid Deaths</a>">CSV File</a>

#### Questions

I try to come up with interesting and challenging questions for this project, ones that would push me to think creatively. Some of these questions emerged in the middle of the project as I found inspiration while working through the data.

**Primary objectives**
- Provide Statistics of Covid in the World
- Simulate Forcasting
- Utilize Skillset in Project


#### Data Cleaning
 I didn’t do much data cleaning in the Excel/CSV file as I was following the tutorial closely. In hindsight, I realized that many of the columns in the dataset were unnecessary. To address this, I created a sample of how I would clean up the data and included small charts and presentations to illustrate the process.


  
#### Data Analysis

Using SQL I tried to answer the questions that I asked at the start
